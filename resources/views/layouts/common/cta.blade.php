      <h2>What is CryptoCurrency?</h2>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for
        goods and services. Many companies have issued their own currencies,
        often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good
        or service that the company provides.Youâ€™ll need to exchange real
        currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.
        Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. Blockchain
        is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that
        manages and records transactions.
